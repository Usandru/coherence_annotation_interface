# Experiment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

It uses:
PYTHON
flask
flask_cors
flask_restful
flask_jsonpify
ANGULAR
Ng5Slider
ngx-bootstrap

## Run server

Run `ng serve` for the client-side. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

Run `python server.py` for the server-side. Both must be running simultaneously for the system to work.

Log files are written to `.\sessions\`, if a session is not finished (and the client returns to the selector screen) the next session will overwrite the log.
